# Pacman Search Project

## Overview
The Pacman Search Project demonstrates the application of various search algorithms within the Pacman game context. It includes implementations for Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search, each tailored to help Pacman navigate the maze effectively, avoid ghosts, and collect all food dots.

## Key Features
- **Search Algorithms**: Implementation of DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* to solve navigation and pathfinding problems in Pacman.
- **Multi-Scenario Solutions**: Each algorithm is tested against multiple layouts and scenarios to showcase its efficiency and limitations.
- **Path Optimization**: Focus on optimizing paths to ensure that Pacman collects all food dots in the least number of steps.
- **Ghost Avoidance**: Strategies to navigate around ghosts using informed and uninformed search strategies.
